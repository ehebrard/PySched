# PySched
Scheduling algorithms and latex examples generator in Python

Sorry, not enough time to write a proper readme. Just run the examples (in demo/ or in examples/) and try to follow what's going on

Also, you may try:
python PySched/tools/solver.py data/osp/hurley/j5-per0-0.txt

or better

pypy PySched/tools/solver.py data/osp/hurley/j5-per0-0.txt

if pypy is installed on your machine
